# Block'oMorph
**Block'oMorph** - is a mod for minecraft that allows you to turn into blocks like in the mini game block hunt, with it you can turn into blocks of varying complexity, from the simplest stone to a sign with text or a portal to the end.

You can do this in two ways, **open the GUI** for transforming into a block and find the block you need in the creative tab and then configure its ready-made nbt tag and select the necessary block state, or **write the /blockmorph command** if you need to transform using a command block or console.

Also, in addition to the basic transformation with a change of model, texture and hitbox, you will also have access to:

- Full collisions, you will be able to step on player blocks with a complex Voxelshape shape and not fall through them or get stuck, because even though the player block will have a 1x1x1 hitbox, it will have the shape of a block.

- Block breaking system, the player block can be destroyed with all the effects and mechanics, as if you were breaking a regular block, the player block will emit particles, crack, and also take into account your game mode, effects and tool.

- Rendering of block entities, you will be able to see all the block entities into which the player has turned, and you can customize them through the block nbt.
